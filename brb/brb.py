"""BRB RIMER implementation.

Based on "Belief Rule-Base Inference Methodology Using the Evidential Reasoning
Approach - RIMER", by _Yang et al._, this module implements three data
structures to construct expert systems based on the Evidential Reasoning
approach.

    Typical usage example:

    >>> from brb import RuleBaseModel, Rule, AttributeInput
    >>> model = RuleBaseModel(
    ...     U=['Antecedent'],
    ...     D=['good', 'bad']
    ... )
    >>> model.add_rule(Rule(
    ...     A_values={'Antecedent':'good'},
    ...     beta=[1,0]
    ... ))
    >>> model.add_rule(Rule(
    ...     A_values={'Antecedent':'bad'},
    ...     beta=[0,1]
    ... ))
    >>> X = AttributeInput({'Antecedent': {'good': 1, 'bad': 0}})
    >>> model.run(X)
    [1.0, 0.0]
    >>> X = AttributeInput({'Antecedent': {'good': 0.3, 'bad': 0.7}})
    >>> model.run(X)
